This is the opening draft for an app to get users to Denver happy hours faster and easier.
This app makes use of the Foursquare API to show venues with a happy hour menu listed on Foursquare.
Mostly, this initial attempt highlights the need for this app as the API is severly lacking
in content related to happy hours.  The end goal will be creating a new API geared towards
Happy Hours first, with other venue information available second.
